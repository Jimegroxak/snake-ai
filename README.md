This repo utilizes Deep Q Learning to train an AI on a Python version of the game Snake.
The AI is trained by taking state data including direction, presence of danger, and location of food.

TO RUN:

Simply download the repo and run the file agent.py. There is an agent2.py that I was experimenting with, but it is not as good as the first agent.
